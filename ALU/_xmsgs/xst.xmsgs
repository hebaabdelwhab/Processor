<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="3001" delta="old" >This design contains one or more registers or latches with an active
asynchronous set and asynchronous reset. While this circuit can be built,
it creates a sub-optimal implementation in terms of area, power and
performance. For a more optimal implementation Xilinx highly recommends
one of the following:

       1) Remove either the set or reset from all registers and latches if
          not needed for required functionality
       2) Modify the code in order to produce a synchronous set
          and/or reset (both is preferred)
       3) Use the -async_to_sync option to transform the asynchronous
          set/reset to synchronous operation
          (timing simulation highly recommended when using this option)

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2169" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
